## Problem statement
This repository contains source code for a website which
matches urban workers who seek the job with their clients

## Workflow
 - It lists down the registered urban workers
 - The needed people can hire them in th.is platform.
 - We will create a website and put the data of available workers


## Future Goals
We thought of implementing backend to the website, so that,
the workers can also register themselves manually which will
be accepted after verification from the server side manually
to avoid potential issues.
